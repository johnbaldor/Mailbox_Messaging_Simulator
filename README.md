Mailbox Messaging Program
This program implements a thread-based message passing mechanism in C/C++ using semaphores and pthreads. Each thread is assigned a mailbox where messages can be sent and received. The program allows threads to communicate by sending and receiving messages to and from each otherâ€™s mailboxes, with proper synchronization using semaphores.

To compile the program, run the command:
gcc -pthread mailbox.c -o mailbox

To run the program, use the command:
./mailbox [number_of_threads]

Example:
./mailbox 3

Features
Message Passing: Threads can send and receive messages through individual mailboxes, blocking when necessary to avoid conflicts.
Synchronization: Uses semaphores to manage access to mailboxes and ensure message delivery.
Thread Management: Supports multiple threads (up to 10), with each thread summing values received in messages.
Non-blocking Send (NBSendMsg): An additional feature that allows messages to be sent without blocking, returning a code if the mailbox is full.
Queue of Undelivered Messages: Maintains a queue of undelivered requests when using the non-blocking send feature.
How to Run the Non-blocking Version
To run the non-blocking version of the program, use:
./mailbox [number_of_threads] nb
